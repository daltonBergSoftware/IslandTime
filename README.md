# IslandTime
A personal website that I created for fun. Island Time is an idea created by my friends and I as a kind of clothing/marketing/beverage company. Similar to what Full Send is now, Island Time is a phrase to describe an ideal period of time where you're no worrying about anything but having fun. I thought it'd be a fun idea to use my skills to create a mock website for our idea.
